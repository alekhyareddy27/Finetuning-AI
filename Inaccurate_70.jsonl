This method is useful when the number of clusters is not known a priori or when analyzing the data at different levels of clustering granularity is desired. It's akin to organizing your files into folders, subfolders, and sub-subfolders based on their content and relationships."}]}

Some algorithms, like DBSCAN, can perform well by focusing on density rather than distance. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or t-SNE, are often used before clustering to make the data more manageable. It's like reducing a thick book into a summary that captures the essential points, making it easier to understand the story."}]}
