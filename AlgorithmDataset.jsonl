Techniques like the Elbow Method or the Silhouette Coefficient can provide guidance, but the decision may also require domain knowledge and intuition. It's like deciding how many sections to divide a book into; the optimal number enhances understanding without overcomplicating the structure."}]}

A high score suggests the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters, akin to finding the right fit in a community where you share more commonalities with your neighbors than with those in distant neighborhoods."}]}
